		In the Mexican lottery, the "La Maceta" card is one of the figures that appears in the game and represents an everyday object that is very present in many Mexican homes. The flowerpot is a container used to plant flowers, plants or herbs, and is associated with gardening, growing and caring for plants. This symbol highlights the close relationship that Mexicans have with nature and domestic life.

The flowerpot not only reflects the importance of nature, but also the constant work and care given to plants and flowers, symbolizing growth, patience and dedication. In Mexican culture, flowerpots are often colorfully decorated and are a decorative element in homes, patios and gardens.
